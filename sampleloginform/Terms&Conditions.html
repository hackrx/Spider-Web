      <h4>Terms and Conditions:</h4>
          <p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of SpiderWeb websites, their content and any

      acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. The Service is available only to individuals 
      who are at least 14 years old.</p>

      <p>If you operate a SpiderWeb site, post material to the Service, post links on your site, or otherwise
      make or allow any third party to make material available by means of the Service (any such material,
      "Content"), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content.
      That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio 
      file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>

          harmful or destructive content;</li>
        <li>The Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical
        or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search
        engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead 
        recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>
        <li>The Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not 
        violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;your site is not getting advertised

        web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;</li>
        <li>Your site is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are 
        another person or company. For example, your site's URL or name is not the name of a person other
        than yourself or company other than your own.</li>
        <li>The Content is uploaded with the intent of publishing it via the Service. You may not, under 
        any circumstances, use the Service for general file sharing or online storage.</li>
        <li>
        The User is responsible for any contents provided or stored by him on his SpiderWeb page. The Service Provider is under no obligation to inspect the SpiderWeb page of the SpiderWeb Users with regard to violations of law.
        </li>
        <li>The user is responsible for complying with all laws for their jurisdiction
</li>
<li>
The User undertakes not to take any actions that may infringe or violate the rights of third parties (including their personality rights) when using the SpiderWeb services.
</li>
<li>
The User undertakes not to provide any contents which are legally prohibited or contra bonos mores (in particular pornographic, racist, xenophobic, extremist or any other reprehensible contents) or may infringe the rights of third parties (in particular trademarks, rights to bear a name and copyrights). Moreover, the SpiderWeb User undertakes not to use a SpiderWeb Page for the purposes of spamming or SpiderWeb sites for “linkbuilding” activities. In the event of claims due to illegal content which the User has placed on a SpiderWeb site, the User agrees to indemnify and hold SpiderWeb harmless from any claim or demand. The user also agrees to assist SpiderWeb in every manner in responding to and in defense of such claims.</li>
<li>The SpiderWeb User is under an obligation to regularly back up all data files and software settings to which he has access. In all cases the SpiderWeb User is required to take appropriate data backup measures before making changes to his SpiderWebPage and, provided that the Service Provider has notified the User in due time, before maintenance work is carried out by the Service Provider. Under no circumstances may backup copies be saved on SpiderWeb’s servers.
</li>
<li> SpiderWeb is not liable for loss of data by the User or for unauthorized access to personal user data by third-parties (e.g. hackers).
</li><li> SpiderWeb also cannot be held liable for misuse by third parties of data and information made available to them by the Users themselves
</li><li> SpiderWeb shall not be liable for any activities of or contents posted by the Users.
</li>
<li>
The SpiderWeb User is aware of the fact that from a technical point of view SpiderWeb is able to view any of the data saved on the SpiderWeb server and that there is a theoretical possibility that the SpiderWeb Users data may be accessed by unauthorized third-parties when transmitting the data over the Internet.</li>
      </ul></div>
      <p>By submitting Content to SpiderWeb for publishing, you grant SpiderWeb a world-wide, royalty-free,
      and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the content solely for the purpose 
      of displaying, distributing and promoting your site. If you delete content, SpiderWeb will use reasonable
      efforts to remove it from the Service, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the content may 
      not be made immediately unavailable.</p>
      <p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, SpiderWeb has the right (though not the 
      obligation) to, in SpiderWeb's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in SpiderWeb's 
      reasonable opinion, violates any SpiderWeb policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) 
      terminate or deny access to and use of the Service to any individual or entity for any reason, in 
      SpiderWeb's sole discretion.</p>
      <p>
      The SpiderWeb user confirms that all the personal data provided is true and complete. The SpiderWeb user hereby agrees to the recording and electronic storage of this data by the Service Provider. The Service Provider will not transfer the data to third parties unless the SpiderWeb User expressly agrees to this or the transfer is necessary to fulfill the services (for example, sharing of data for domain registration with the domain registrar). The SpiderWeb user undertakes to keep the personal data updated. In order to prevent abuse by unauthorized third parties, the SpiderWeb User is under an obligation to keep the login data confidential
      </p>
      <p>
      The Service Provider will endeavor to ensure that the services are available and function properly at all times. The User acknowledges, however, that for technical reasons as well as due to the Service Provider's dependence on external factors, e.g. telecommunications networks, the uninterrupted availability of individual SpiderWebPages cannot be guaranteed. The SpiderWeb User can therefore not assert a claim for continual access to the SpiderWeb Pages. Access restrictions of only a temporary nature shall not constitute grounds for warranty claims nor a right to extraordinary termination. In addition to the possible access restrictions due to circumstances beyond the Service Providers control, the Service Provider also reserves the right to impose temporal and/or complete access restrictions, particularly where the SpiderWeb Page is temporarily disabled for the purpose of installing technical improvements or eliminating errors and defects, etc.</p>
      <p>If you find a SpiderWeb site that you believe violates our terms of service, please let us know.</p>
      <h6>Domain Names</h6>
      <p>If you are registering a domain name, using or transferring a previously registered domain name, you
        acknowledge and agree that use of the domain name is also subject to the policies of the Internet 
        Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), including their Registration Rights and Responsibilities.</p>

                <li>use as a SpiderWeb URL a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The SpiderWeb pages of free users are published under a sub-domain (e.g., www.username SpiderWeb.com). Free users are not permitted to redirect an externally hosted domain to their SpiderWeb pages or to display the SpiderWeb page on an external Website (e.g. integration via frame or Iframe).</p>
            <p> SpiderWeb reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a SpiderWeb URL in its discretion.</p>
            <h6>Changes</h6>
            <p >SpiderWeb reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement.
            It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access
            to the Service following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.
            SpiderWeb may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Service (including, the release
            of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions 
            of this Agreement.</p>
            <h6>Termination</h6>
            <p> SpiderWeb may terminate your access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with
            or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your SpiderWeb account, you 
            may simply discontinue using the Service. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive 
            termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
            indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
            <p>
            In the event that the SpiderWeb free user fails to log onto his account within 180 days, the Service Provider may delete the pages and its contents permanently and suspend all access to SpiderWeb by the User.
            </p>
            <p>
            SpiderWeb reserves the right to make use of the services of third parties in providing services.
